## initial release
If you use `publish-local` to test plugins and libraries, and you find yourself clearing Ivy2 cache often, this is a tool for you.

The plugin is intended to be used as a global plugin. It automatically adds three global tasks to sbt prompt `clean-cache`, `clean-local` and `clean-ivy` along with some settings like `clean-cache-files`, `clean-local-files` and `clean-ivy-files`.
